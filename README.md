## Grading Policy

## AI Policy
Insert AI policy. This is especially important since different classes have different views on using generative AI in the classroom. Please clearly outline what is and is not allowed so that students understand what will be in violation of the Honor Code. 

For example: 
*  I have no rules against using ChatGPT or other LLMs to provide you with longer explanations of concepts, to tutor you, or to quiz you and test your learning. You can use Generative AI as a study partner - however, you may not use it to generate answers on assignments and quizzes.
