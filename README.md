**Disclaimer**: This is a condensed version of the full syllabus - more information can be found in the other files in this repository. I aim to make the class more inclusive, starting with an easy-to-read, short document that outlines the basic information of this course.  If you are facing issues with accessibility or inclusivity, I encourage you all to reach out to me anytime.

## Grading Policy
Insert grading policy. 

Some things to note - are there any curves? any extra credit opportunities?

## AI Policy
Insert AI policy. This is especially important since different classes have different views on using generative AI in the classroom. Please clearly outline what is and is not allowed so that students understand what is in violation of the Honor Code. 

For example: 
*  I have no rules against using ChatGPT or other LLMs to provide you with longer explanations of concepts, to tutor you, or to quiz you and test your learning. You can use Generative AI as a study partner - however, you may not use it to generate answers on assignments and quizzes.
