# Accessibility and Support Resources
## Accessibility:
It is our goal at the School of Data Science to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options.

If you need formal accommodations for a disability (e.g., in arrangements for seating, extended time for examinations, or note-taking, etc.), you have a right to have these met. Please contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) at 434-243-5180/Voice, 434-465-6579/Video Phone, 434-243-5188/Fax as soon as possible to make a request. Once accommodations are approved, call or email me so that we can discuss a plan. Please try to make accommodations for test-taking at least 14 business days in advance of the date of the test(s). Further policies and statements are available [here](www.virginia.edu/studenthealth/sdac/sdac.html).

## Student Safety: 
We are committed to preventing and addressing discrimination, harassment, and retaliation in the classroom and School activities and programs. The University's [Preventing and Addressing Discrimination and Harrassment](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-009) (PADH) policy prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of age, color, race, disability, marital status, military status (including active duty service members, reserve service members, and dependents), national and ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran status, family medical or genetic information, as well as other forms of sex discrimination not covered by the University’s [Policy on Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment and Other Forms of Interpersonal Violence](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-041).

## Religious Accommodations:
It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing directly to the instructor of the course. You may contact the UVA Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights at uvaeocr@virginia.edu or (434) 924-3200 if you have any questions regarding this policy, which is set forth in the Academic Accommodation for Religious Observances section of PROV-008: Teaching Courses for Academic Credit, the Undergraduate Record, and the Graduate Record.

## Student Wellbeing
We care about your well-being. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated, there are many individuals who want to provide help. You can make an appointment to talk with any of your instructors. The Student Health Center also offers Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for all students. Call 434-243-5150 or the after-hours number at 434-972-7004 to schedule an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and confidentially over the phone, call Madison House’s HELP line any time of the day at 434-295-8255. There is also support if you or someone you know experiences stalking, partner violence, or sexual assault.
